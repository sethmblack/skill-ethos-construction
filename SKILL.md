# Ethos Construction

Build character-based credibility and trust with any audience through demonstrated virtue, practical wisdom, and genuine goodwill.

---

## When to Use

- User says "How do I establish credibility?" or "They don't trust me"
- Addressing a new or skeptical audience
- Proposing something that requires trust (sales, leadership, expertise)
- Recovering from a credibility setback
- Speaking on a topic where qualifications are questioned

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | What you're trying to persuade them of |
| audience | Yes | Who you need to trust you |
| your_background | No | Credentials, experience, or relevant history |
| current_perception | No | How they currently see you |
| obstacles | No | Specific credibility challenges to overcome |

## The Three Pillars of Ethos

Aristotle identified three components of character that create persuasive credibility:

### 1. Phronesis (Practical Wisdom)
**"They know what they're talking about"**

The audience believes you have the knowledge, experience, and judgment to speak on this topic.

**Demonstration techniques:**
- Reference relevant experience without bragging
- Show deep understanding of the specific context
- Anticipate complexities before they're raised
- Use precise rather than vague language
- Acknowledge nuance and tradeoffs
- Cite sources appropriately (but don't over-cite)

**Language patterns:**
- "In my experience with similar situations..."
- "What the research shows, and what I've seen in practice..."
- "The key factor that most people miss..."
- "There are tradeoffs here - let me walk you through them..."

**Mistakes to avoid:**
- Claiming expertise you don't have
- Using jargon to seem smart (signals insecurity)
- Ignoring legitimate complexity
- Pretending certainty where uncertainty exists

---

### 2. Arete (Virtue/Integrity)
**"They do the right thing"**

The audience believes you are honest, fair, and operate from good values.

**Demonstration techniques:**
- Acknowledge limitations and unknowns
- Credit others; don't claim undue credit
- Admit mistakes or past errors
- Show consistency between words and actions
- Demonstrate fairness to opposing views
- Take positions that cost you something

**Language patterns:**
- "I should be transparent that..."
- "To be fair to the other perspective..."
- "I was wrong about X, and here's what I learned..."
- "I'm not certain about this, but my best judgment is..."
- "This actually goes against my initial preference, but..."

**Mistakes to avoid:**
- Overselling or exaggerating
- Hiding conflicts of interest
- Being defensive about limitations
- Strawmanning opponents

---

### 3. Eunoia (Goodwill)
**"They care about my interests"**

The audience believes you genuinely want what's good for them, not just for yourself.

**Demonstration techniques:**
- Show you understand their specific situation
- Reference their goals and concerns explicitly
- Acknowledge the costs/risks to them
- Put their interests ahead of your convenience
- Ask about their needs before proposing solutions
- Demonstrate investment in the relationship

**Language patterns:**
- "What matters most to you in this situation?"
- "I can see why you'd be concerned about..."
- "Even if you don't choose us, you should look for..."
- "Your time is valuable, so let me get straight to..."
- "I want to make sure this actually solves your problem, not just mine"

**Mistakes to avoid:**
- Rushing to solution before understanding
- Obvious self-interest that undermines goodwill claims
- Generic pitches that show no understanding of them
- Promising things you can't deliver

---

## Building Ethos Before You Speak

### Borrowed Ethos
- Be introduced by someone they trust
- Reference shared connections
- Cite respected authorities in the field
- Associate with trusted institutions
- Use social proof appropriately

### Demonstrated Ethos
- Share relevant work or track record
- Provide something valuable before asking for anything
- Show up prepared (demonstrates respect)
- Be consistent in small things (builds trust for big things)

---

## Recovering Damaged Ethos

If credibility has been damaged:

1. **Acknowledge the problem directly** - Don't pretend it didn't happen
2. **Take responsibility without excessive defense** - "I was wrong. Here's what happened."
3. **Show what you've learned** - "Here's what I'm doing differently"
4. **Rebuild through action, not words** - Demonstrated change beats promised change
5. **Be patient** - Trust rebuilds slowly

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown

### Ethos-Building Actions Before/During Communication

[Specific actions to take]

### Red Flags to Avoid

[Behaviors that would undermine credibility with this audience]
```

---

## Constraints

- Be specific to the audience - different audiences value different markers
- Recommend authenticity over performance - fake ethos backfires
- Note when borrowed ethos is available (introductions, endorsements)
- Acknowledge when genuine ethos is missing and must be built over time
- Balance all three pillars - weakness in one undermines the others

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I'm a young manager presenting a change initiative to senior leaders who've been at the company for 20+ years. They're skeptical of 'kids with ideas.'"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Ethos Construction: Young Manager to Senior Leaders

### Current Credibility Assessment
You face the classic age/experience gap. They likely assume you lack organizational knowledge, historical context, and battle scars. The danger: they'll dismiss you before hearing your ideas. The opportunity: genuine humility combined with real preparation can flip the script.

### Phronesis (Practical Wisdom)

**Key expertise to demonstrate:**
- Deep knowledge of the specific problem and current data
- Understanding of why previous attempts may have failed
- Awareness of constraints they know about

**Language suggestions:**
- "I've talked to people in the field and reviewed the past three years of data..."
- "I know we tried something similar in 2018. I spoke with [Name] about why that didn't work, and here's what's different..."
- "You've seen more of these initiatives than I have. I'd genuinely like your perspective on the obstacles I might not be seeing."

**Pitfalls to avoid:**
- Don't pretend you have experience you lack
- Don't use theory without connecting to their practical reality
- Don't dismiss "the old way" - understand it first

---

### Arete (Virtue/Integrity)

**How to demonstrate honesty and fairness:**
- Acknowledge your relative inexperience directly
- Credit the foundation their work has built
- Admit the limits of your proposal

**Language suggestions:**
- "I've been here three years. You've been building this organization for twenty. I'm not here to tell you how it should be done - I'm here to offer a perspective and ask for your guidance."
- "This proposal builds on what's already working. Let me show you where I'm proposing changes and where I'm proposing we keep what you've built."
- "I'm not certain this will work. What I'm certain of is the problem. I'd rather we try something imperfect than leave the problem unaddressed."

**What NOT to hide:**
- Your relative inexperience
- The risks of your proposal
- Any data that complicates your case

---

### Eunoia (Goodwill)

**How to show you care about their interests:**
- Understand what they've invested in and don't threaten it carelessly
- Show respect for their legacy
- Frame change as building on success, not repudiating it

**Language suggestions:**
- "I know you've invested years in the current system. I'm not proposing we throw that out."
- "What would make this easier for your teams? I'd rather adapt the plan than force a bad fit."
- "My goal is to make you look good, not me. How can we position this so it's a win for your group?"

**Questions to ask first:**
- "What have you seen work in the past with initiatives like this?"
- "What concerns would you have if you were in my position?"
- "Who else should I talk to before finalizing this?"

---

### Ethos-Building Actions Before the Presentation

1. **Talk to them individually first** - Get their concerns early, incorporate feedback, let them feel heard
2. **Find a senior sponsor** - Borrowed ethos from someone they respect
3. **Show your homework** - Reference conversations you've had, data you've gathered
4. **Be over-prepared** - They will test you

### Red Flags to Avoid

- Arrogance or "you don't understand" attitude
- Dismissing the past as broken
- Appearing to want personal credit
- Rushing to convince rather than consulting
- Using trendy jargon they associate with naive outsiders

---

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Cicero** expert persona and focuses specifically on building ethos (one of the three appeals). Pairs naturally with:
- **Five Canons Analysis** (comprehensive preparation)
- **Emotional Amplification** (ethos + pathos together)
- **Decorum Assessment** (what this audience values)
